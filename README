typica 0.5

This is a simple API to access Amazon's SQS and EC2 web services. It uses the REST/QUERY interface and patterns the methods after those available from Amazon in their SOAP client for these services. This code is thread-safe and works very reliably to the best of my knowledge. I've been using it on a system where sending messages in SQS is critical and we manage pools of servers in EC2.

Distribution files;
README      - this file
lgpl.txt    - full version of the LGPL license
Log4J.xml   - a Log4J config file you can include in your classpath
typica.jar  - the classes for this release
apidocs     - JavaDoc for this release

Test files
In subversion, the test directory contains some java test files. Sample code is also documented on the wiki @ http://code.google.com/p/typica/wiki/TypicaSampleCode. These can be used as sample files and to test various features of the client code. There is a target "test.main". To invoke the sample code, you can use this target like this;
ant test.main -Dclass=TestQueueService -Dargs=testQueue

Base64 coder included. 
I've included the encoder/decoder written by Christian d'Heureuse. The full class name is ch.inventec.Base64Coder. (that is the domain where I found the code). Typica doesn't yet use it directly, but since many SQS messages need base64 encoding, I've included it for convenience.
