typica 0.5
04-May-2007

http://code.google.com/p/typica

This is a simple API to access Amazon's SQS and EC2 web services. It uses the QUERY interface and patterns the methods after those available from Amazon in their SOAP client for these services. This code is thread-safe and works very reliably to the best of my knowledge. I've been using it on a system where sending messages in SQS is critical and we manage pools of servers in EC2.

Distribution files;
README      - this file
lgpl.txt    - full version of the LGPL license
Log4J.xml   - a Log4J config file you can include in your classpath
typica.jar  - the classes for this release
apidocs     - JavaDoc for this release

Test files
In subversion, the test directory contains some java test files. Sample code is also documented on the wiki @ http://code.google.com/p/typica/wiki/TypicaSampleCode. These can be used as sample files and to test various features of the client code. There is a target "test.main". To invoke the sample code, you can use this target like this;
ant test.main -Dclass=TestQueueService -Dargs=testQueue

Base64 coder included. 
I've included the encoder/decoder written by Christian d'Heureuse. The full class name is ch.inventec.Base64Coder. (that is the domain where I found the code). Typica doesn't yet use it directly, but since many SQS messages need base64 encoding, I've included it for convenience.
